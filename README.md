# Word Game

An accessible version of the famous [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

**Launch the game [here](https://project-wordle-sigma.vercel.app/).**

This game was built as part of the projects for Josh Comeau's course [The Joy of React](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react). Additional features were added, including:

1. a visual keyboard that indicates whether a letter has been checked or not.
2. a reset button to restart the game.
